"""
Imagine we have an image where every pixel is white or black.
Weâ€™ll represent this image as a simple 2D array (0 = black, 1 = white).
The image you get is known to have a single black rectangle on a white 
background. 

Write a function that takes in the image and 
returns the coordinates of the rectangle 
-- either top-left and bottom-right; or top-left, width, and height.
